# Tails or Types? A Critical Systematic Review of Taxometric Studies of Neurodevelopmental Conditions

This repo contains materials for a project which critically examines the use of **taxometric analysis** in published studies on neurodevelopmental conditions (NDCs), including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), ADHD, Learning Disorders, and related conditions. A systematic review is conducted, with no meta-analysis as the available evidence is too scattered across disorders and methodologically heterogeneous. A specific focus of the review is to consider the methodological threats to validity of taxometric conclusions.

Taxometric analysis is designed to test whether latent structures are **categorical (taxonic)** or **dimensional**. Despite its relevance, it has been underused in NDC research, and when applied, it is often affected by methodological issues such as **artificial admixture**, a practice that can produce spurious evidence for categorical structures.

The repo also includes the preregistration protocol for the review, and includes R code of a Monte Carlo simulation that illustrates how artificial admixture can lead to high rates of false positive taxonic findings.
