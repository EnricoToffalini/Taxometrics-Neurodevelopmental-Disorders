The primary objective of this study was to use a multi‐method approach to examine the broad latent categorical versus dimensional structure of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Method Data were aggregated across seven independent samples of participants with ASD, other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), and non‐ASD/NDD controls (aggregate Ns = 512–16,755; ages 1.5–22). Scores from four distinct phenotype measures formed composite “indicators” of the latent ASD construct. The primary indicator set included eye gaze metrics from seven distinct social stimulus paradigms. Logistic regressions were used to combine gaze metrics within/across paradigms, and derived predicted probabilities served as indicator values. Secondary indicator sets were constructed from clinical observation and parent‐report measures of ASD symptoms.

With the advances in technology to identify this group of disorders, children are being identified at younger and younger ages. Early identification of ASD is critical due to the beneficial effects of early intensive behavioral interventions. While children are being diagnosed with the disorder at very high rates, etiology and definitions of the disorders are still being investigated. Great variability exists with regard to symptoms between individuals. Additionally, less is known about symptom expression in individuals without ASD and symptoms of ASD occurring as a discrete category or along a dimension across populations. Taxometric analysis was employed to determine the underlying latent structure of ASD in toddlers at risk for developmental disabilities.

Each of the procedures that comprise the taxometric method is conceptually and mathematically distinct. The three primary taxometric procedures are: Means Above Minus Below a Cut (MAMBAC), Paul E. Meehl and Leslie J. Yonce (see record [rid]1995-08099-001[/rid]); MAXimum covariance (MAXCOV), Paul E. Meehl and Leslie J.

The primary way in which all three of these taxometric procedures were interpreted was by examining the shape of the graphs they yielded. Taxometric analysis is focused on the latent level of analysis, and is thus a form of statistical analysis concerned with the unobservable nature of constructs.

Research into the subtypes suggests that the combined subtype of ADHD and the inattentive subtype of ADHD have qualities unique enough that they might be different disorders possessing unique age of onset, unique comorbid status with other psychological disorders, and unique learning abilities. That they share inattention deficits and may share comorbid psychological disorders has complicated the research into differences. The present research applied taxometric analyses to answer the question. Archival data of combined clinical and school samples of children with ADHD (N=398) were tested using MAXCOV and MAMBAC analyses. Indicators tested were inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity and sluggish cognitive tempo. The MAXCOV successfully completed the analyses on the indicators inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity; and divided the sample by hyperactivit","2006","2025-04-20 16:19:15","2025-04-20 16:19:15","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: 2006-99014-22720060101 Type: $type tex.entrytype: masterthesis","","","","Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Childhood (birth-12 yrs); Childhood Development; Comorbidity; Diagnosis; Impulsiveness; Subtypes (Disorders); Tempo","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Latent class cluster analysis (LCCA) can be used to classify children, using direct data from any instrument that reports these symptoms, without previous gold standard diagnosis. One ADHD symptoms checklist, and one ADHD comorbidities questionnaire were used. LCCAs were developed for each instrument, which were administered to a sample of 540 children and adolescents, aged 4-17 years, from the regular school of Manizales-Colombia. A simple correspondence analysis (SCA) was done to determine the relationships between the groups classified from both LCCAs. Six clusters were obtained from ADHD checklist and five from the ADHD comorbidities questionnaire. SCA found four independent groups, derived from the concordances between the 11 clusters obtained by the LCCAs from both instruments. These findings suggest that LCCA and SCA can be use as accurate taxometric procedures to classif","2007","2025-04-20 16:19:15","2025-04-20 16:19:15","","409-423","","2","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: 2008-01388-01720070101","","","","Adolescence (13-17 yrs); Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Childhood (birth-12 yrs); Cluster Analysis; Comorbidity; Preschool Age (2-5 yrs); School Age (6-12 yrs); Severity (Disorders); Symptoms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
