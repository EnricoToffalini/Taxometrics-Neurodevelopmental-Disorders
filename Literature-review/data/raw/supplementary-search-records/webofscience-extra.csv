In this study, distributions of language scores from children at ages 3 (N = 620) and 4 (N = 623) years were analyzed using a taxometric procedure known as mean above minus below a cut (MAMBAC; P. E.

Method: A taxometric analysis of language scores from 601 six-year-old children who were free of neonatal risk factors was performed. From among 4 candidate indicators of SLI, 2 were eligible for the mean above minus below a cut (MAMBAC) procedure (Meehl & Yonce, 1994): number of different words (NDW) produced in a language sample and average percentage phonemes repeated correctly in 3- and 4-syllable nonwords (3-4 PPC). Graphs of these MAMBAC variables were inspected to determine whether they patterned in a manner suggesting the presence of a discrete category, having either a central peak or a steep curve peaking near the final interval. Results: MAMBAC curves for NDW and 3-4 PPC did not suggest the presence of a taxon, and results did not vary during consistency checks in which MAMBAC parameters and cutoff values for language deficits were manipulated. Conclusions: Results suggest that for these measures, children with specific language deficits are those falling at the lower end of a continuous distribution of language skills rather than a qualitatively distinct group.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1092-4388,1558-9102,,,,OCT 1,2011,54,5,,,,,1361,1371,,10.1044/1092-4388(2011/10-0187),http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/1092-4388(2011/10-0187),,,,,,,,21646422,,,,,WOS:000295537200010,View Full Record in Web of Science

The symptoms of the disorder are sensitive to the type of language being acquired, with extraordinary weaknesses seen in those areas of language that are relatively challenging for younger typically developing children.

J,"Lancaster, HS; Camarata, S",,,,"Lancaster, Hope S.; Camarata, Stephen",,,Reconceptualizing developmental language disorder as a spectrum disorder: issues and evidence,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE & COMMUNICATION DISORDERS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background There is considerable variability in the presentation of developmental language disorder (DLD). Disagreement amongst professionals about how to characterize and interpret the variability complicates both the research on understanding the nature of DLD and the best clinical framework for diagnosing and treating children with DLD. We describe and statistically examine three primary possible models for characterizing the variability in presentation in DLD: predictable subtypes; individual differences; and continuum/spectrum. Aims To test these three models of DLD in a population-based sample using two distinct types of cluster analyses. Methods & Procedures This study included children with DLD (n = 505) from the US Epidemiological Study of Language Impairment database. All available language and cognitive measures were included. Two cluster methods were used: Ward's method and K-means. Optimal cluster sizes were selected using Bayesian information criteria (BIC). Bootstrapping and permutation methods were used to evaluate randomness of clustering. Outcomes & Results Both clustering analyses yielded more than 10 clusters, and the clusters did not have spatial distinction: many of these clusters were not clinically interpretable. However, tests of random clustering revealed that the cluster solutions obtained did not arise from random aggregation. Conclusions & Implications Non-random clustering coupled with a large number of non-interpretable subtypes provides empirical support for the continuum/spectrum and individual differences models. Although there was substantial support for the continuum/spectrum model and weaker support for the individual differences model, additional research testing these models should be completed. Based on these results, clinicians working with children with DLD should focus on creating treatment plans that address the severity of functioning rather than seeking to identify and treat distinct subtypes. Additional consideration should be given to reconceptualizing DLD as a spectrum condition.",,,,,"Lancaster, Hope/AAP-8691-2021; Camarata, Stephen/KQU-0477-2024","Lancaster, Hope/0000-0001-9924-9508; Camarata, Stephen/0000-0002-3342-1747",,,,,,,,,,,,,1368-2822,1460-6984,,,,JAN-FEB,2019,54,1,,,,,79,94,,10.1111/1460-6984.12433,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1460-6984.12433,,,,,,,,30426606,,,,,WOS:000454678800010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Syntactic profiles are atypical, with poor performance on non-canonical structures, e.g. object relatives, suggesting a localized deficit. However, existing analyses using ANOVAs are problematic because they do not systematically address unequal variance, or fully model random effects. Consequently, a Generalised Linear Model (GLM) was used to analyze data from a Sentence Repetition (SR) task involving relative clauses. seventeen children with SLI (mean age 6;7), twenty-one Language Matched (LM) children (mean age 4;8), and seventeen Age Matched (AM) children (mean age 6;5) repeated 100 canonical and non-canonical sentences. ANOVAs found a significant Group by Canonicity interaction for the SLI versus AM contrast only. However, the GLM found no significant interaction. Consequently, arguments for a localized deficit may depend on statistical methods which are prone to exaggerate profile differences.

There is strong evidence that disorders, such as dyslexia and Specific Language Impairment (SLI), have a genetic basis, but we expect the contributing genetic factors to be complex in nature. To date, only a few genes have been implicated in these traits. Their functional characterization has provided novel insight into the biology of neurodevelopmental disorders.

However, it is unclear whether such difficulties separate the individual from the general population qualitatively (i.e., they form a discrete group) or quantitatively (i.e., they represent the lower end of a continuous distribution). Taxometric methods address this question but have rarely been applied to cognitive disorders. This study examined the latent structure of developmental prosopagnosia (DP)- a relatively selective deficit in face recognition that occurs in the absence of neurological injury. Multiple taxometric procedures were applied to dominant diagnostic indices of face recognition ability across two independent datasets. All analyses supported a categorical outcome, even for mild cases of DP, suggesting that it is a qualitatively distinct condition. This finding has significant implications for our understanding of DP given it has traditionally been viewed as a continuous impairment. In particular, existing (arbitrary) diagnostic cut-offs may be too conservative, underestimating prevalence rates and prohibiting big-data approaches to theoretical study. More broadly, these conclusions support application of the taxometric method to many other cognitive processes where weaknesses are predominantly assumed to reside on a continuous distribution.

Method: We conducted an integrative literature review. Conclusions: Considerable gains in understanding the genetics and neurobiology of DLD provide new explanations for long-observed phenomena such as heterogeneity of presentation, phenotypic overlap with other neurodevelopmental conditions, and the challenges of diagnosis. Although categorical nosologies benefit diagnostic decision making, facilitate communication, and align well with bureaucratic systems, they offer overly simple ways of defining DLD. The presentation of DLD is broad rather than narrow, spectral rather than categorical, and dynamic rather than static; therefore, DLD is better described as a multidimensional spectral system than as a categorical entity. It is not practical or even advisable to abandon the traditional categorical framing of DLD at this point. However, maintaining awareness of the tension between the categorical framing and the spectral nature of DLD may improve diagnosis, prognosis, and alignment with the construct of neurodiversity.",,,,,,"McGregor, Karla/0000-0003-0612-0057",,,,,,,,,,,,,1092-4388,1558-9102,,,,DEC,2025,68,12,,,,,6069,6088,,10.1044/2025_JSLHR-25-00089,http://dx.doi.org/10.1044/2025_JSLHR-25-00089,,,,,,,,41237815,,,,,WOS:001650707600028,View Full Record in Web of Science

Given evidence for dimensional distribution of oral language, reading, and mathematical skills among those identified with and without learning disorders, examining learning across a range of abilities and domains should provide a better estimate of learning profiles. The present study examined the 1-year stability of cross-domain learning profiles and associated cognitive characteristics of 327 children. Results revealed highly stable profiles with 95% of participants remaining in the same learning profiles across data years. Generally similar performance across domains was observed for three profiles (below average, average, above average) comprising 63% of the sample, with relatively specific differences in oral language or reading characterizing the remaining profiles. Cognitive measures and teacher ratings accurately predicted learning profile in about 55% of participants either at the time of testing or in the following year. The most effective models for categorizing learning profiles all included teacher ratings of reading. Cognitive measures of verbal working memory, verbal intelligence, phonological awareness, symbolic comparison, and visuospatial working memory were also important contributors to classification.

Children completed behavioral testing in Spanish and English at three time points over a period of 2 years. Growth curve modeling was employed to analyze longitudinal data.Results: Distinct patterns of Spanish and English language growth were observed. While the average standard score in English increased, the average score in Spanish decreased over time for both groups. Children with DLD showed persistent language difficulties in both Spanish and English over time in comparison to their peers. Conclusions: The results of this study provide evidence of a shift in language pro-ficiency from Spanish to English for bilingual children with and without language disorders.
