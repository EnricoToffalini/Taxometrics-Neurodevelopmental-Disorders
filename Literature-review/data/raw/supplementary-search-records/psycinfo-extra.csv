APA PsycInfo,psyh,2004-15693-018,Taxometric Analyses of Specific Language Impairment in 3- and 4-Year-Old Children.,"Specific language impairment (SLI), like many diagnostic labels for complex behavioral conditions, is often assumed to define a category of children who differ not only in degree but also in kind from children developing language normally. Although this assumption has important implications for theoretical models and clinical approaches, its validity has not been tested. In this study, distributions of language scores from children at ages 3 (N=620) and 4 (N=623) years were analyzed using a taxometric procedure known as ""mean above minus below a cut"" (MAMBAC; P. E. Meehl & L. J. Yonce, 1994). Language scores were distributed dimensionally at both ages, failing to support the hypothesis of a qualitatively distinct group corresponding to children with SLI.

APA PsycInfo,psyh,2011-29720-011,Taxometric analyses of specific language impairment in 6-year-old children.,"Purpose: To determine whether language scores at age 6 years suggest that specific language impairments (SLIs) distribute in a categorical or in a dimensional fashion. Method: A taxometric analysis of language scores from 601 six-year-old children who were free of neonatal risk factors was performed. From among 4 candidate indicators of SLI, 2 were eligible for the mean above minus below a cut (MAMBAC) procedure (Meehl & Yonce, 1994): number of different words (NDW) produced in a language sample and average percentage phonemes repeated correctly in 3- and 4-syllable nonwords (3–4 PPC). Graphs of these MAMBAC variables were inspected to determine whether they patterned in a manner suggesting the presence of a discrete category, having either a central peak or a steep curve peaking near the final interval. Results: MAMBAC curves for NDW and 3–4 PPC did not suggest the presence of a taxon, and results did not vary during consistency checks in which MAMBAC parameters and cutoff values for language deficits were manipulated. Conclusions: Results suggest that for these measures, children with specific language deficits are those falling at the lower end of a continuous distribution of language skills rather than a qualitatively distinct group.

APA PsycInfo,psyh,2019-20159-011,Pharmacological treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder and related disorders.,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is marked by intrusive and unwanted images, ideas, and thoughts that may or may not have corresponding ritualistic behavior designed to alleviate them (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). OCD is the reference condition in a separate category, the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (OCRDs). The disorders that make up the OCRDs are OCD, hoarding disorder (HD), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), trichotillomania (TM), and excoriation (skin picking) disorder (ED). In the current edition of the DSM, there is also the diagnostic specifier for OCD related to insight or with co-occurring tic disorders. These disorders could be classified as being more compulsive in nature or more impulsive in nature. The premise that each of the conditions in the OCRDs share common features would suggest similar brain circuitry, neurotransmitter abnormalities, comorbid psychopathology, and treatment response with topographically comparable interventions. For each of these, however, the evidence is limited to nonexistent (Abramowitz, Storch, McKay, Taylor, & Asmundson, 2009), and the aforementioned premise that these conditions rest along a continuum from compulsive to impulsive is likewise not supported (McKay, Abramowitz, & Taylor, 2008). One condition, ED, is the end result of a proposal to include nonsuicidal self-injury in the OCRDs, given the ritual-like process many individuals who deliberately self-harm exhibit. Briefly, ED is characterized by repetitive and compulsive skin picking that leads to tissue damage. It can include damaging the skin with sharp objects, and can be localized to specific areas or be widespread across the body. While ED is part of the OCRDs, it has been argued that this problem is better described as an impulse disorder or one associated with ruminative problems associated with depression rather than OCD (McKay & Andover, 2012). Accordingly, while the remainder of this chapter covers the OCRDs as though they conformed to the philosophical principles that guide valid formation of broad psychiatric taxometric categories (i.e., Zachar, 2008), it is essential to keep in mind that the sorting of disorders into the OCRD is conceptually driven rather than empirically determined.
