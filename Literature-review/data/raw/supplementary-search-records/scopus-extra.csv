Method: A taxometric analysis of language scores from 601 six-year-old children who were free of neonatal risk factors was performed. From among 4 candidate indicators of SLI, 2 were eligible for the mean above minus below a cut (MAMBAC) procedure (Meehl & Yonce, 1994): number of different words (NDW) produced in a language sample and average percentage phonemes repeated correctly in 3- and 4-syllable nonwords (3-4 PPC). Graphs of these MAMBAC variables were inspected to determine whether they patterned in a manner suggesting the presence of a discrete category, having either a central peak or a steep curve peaking near the final interval. Results: MAMBAC curves for NDW and 3-4 PPC did not suggest the presence of a taxon, and results did not vary during consistency checks in which MAMBAC parameters and cutoff values for language deficits were manipulated. Conclusions: Results suggest that for these measures, children with specific language deficits are those falling at the lower end of a continuous distribution of language skills rather than a qualitatively distinct group. © American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80054108441"

Recently, expert consensus has emerged regarding possible candidate disorders [Mataix-Cols, D., Petrusa, A., Leckman, J.F., 2007. Issues for DSM-V: How should obsessive-compulsive and related disorders should be classified. American Journal of Psychiatry, 164, 1313-1314]. Further, expert survey data suggest that obsessive-compulsive disorder is composed of overlapping subtypes. However, methodological approaches for testing whether candidate disorders properly belong in the spectrum have varied widely, and do not necessarily differentiate conditions from subtypes. We describe preliminary methodological and statistical recommendations for a systematic approach to determining what constitutes a subtype, how to determine inclusion in the spectrum, and means for ruling out candidate disorders. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Although this assumption has important implications for theoretical models and clinical approaches, its validity has not been tested. In this study, distributions of language scores from children at ages 3 (N = 620) and 4 (N = 623) years were analyzed using a taxometric procedure known as ""mean above minus below a cut"" (MAMBAC; P. E. Meehl & L. J. Yonce, 1994). Language scores were distributed dimensionally at both ages, failing to support the hypothesis of a qualitatively distinct group corresponding to children with SLI.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-2142643654"
