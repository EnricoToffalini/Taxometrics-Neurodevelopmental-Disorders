"Bate, S; Portch, E; Bennetts, RJ; Parris, BA",0,POPULATION,A taxometric analysis of developmental prosopagnosia: Evidence for a categorically distinct impairment,"Poor performance on cognitive assessment tasks may indicate a selective 'impairment'. However, it is unclear whether such difficulties separate the individual from the general population qualitatively (i.e., they form a discrete group) or quantitatively (i.e., they represent the lower end of a continuous distribution). Taxometric methods address this question but have rarely been applied to cognitive disorders. This study examined the latent structure of developmental prosopagnosia (DP)- a relatively selective deficit in face recognition that occurs in the absence of neurological injury. Multiple taxometric procedures were applied to dominant diagnostic indices of face recognition ability across two independent datasets. All analyses supported a categorical outcome, even for mild cases of DP, suggesting that it is a qualitatively distinct condition. This finding has significant implications for our understanding of DP given it has traditionally been viewed as a continuous impairment. In particular, existing (arbitrary) diagnostic cut-offs may be too conservative, underestimating prevalence rates and prohibiting big-data approaches to theoretical study. More broadly, these conclusions support application of the taxometric method to many other cognitive processes where weaknesses are predominantly assumed to reside on a continuous distribution.

"Archibald, LMD; Cardy, JO; Ansari, D; Olino, T; Joanisse, MF",0,NO_TAXOMETRIC,"The consistency and cognitive predictors of children's oral language, reading, and math learning profiles","Efforts to understand learning disorders in children by focusing on specific domains and within restricted ability ranges have failed to identify consistent and stable learning profiles. Given evidence for dimensional distribution of oral language, reading, and mathematical skills among those identified with and without learning disorders, examining learning across a range of abilities and domains should provide a better estimate of learning profiles. The present study examined the 1-year stability of cross-domain learning profiles and associated cognitive characteristics of 327 children. Results revealed highly stable profiles with 95% of participants remaining in the same learning profiles across data years. Generally similar performance across domains was observed for three profiles (below average, average, above average) comprising 63% of the sample, with relatively specific differences in oral language or reading characterizing the remaining profiles. Cognitive measures and teacher ratings accurately predicted learning profile in about 55% of participants either at the time of testing or in the following year. The most effective models for categorizing learning profiles all included teacher ratings of reading. Cognitive measures of verbal working memory, verbal intelligence, phonological awareness, symbolic comparison, and visuospatial working memory were also important contributors to classification. The findings indicate that examining learning across domains, abilities, and time has the potential to inform our conceptualization of learning disorders and associated cognitive strengths and weaknesses.",10.1016/j.lindif.2019.02.003
"McKay, D.; Neziroglu, F.",0,POPULATION,Methodological issues in the obsessive-compulsive spectrum,"The obsessive-compulsive spectrum is a heterogeneous class of conditions. Recently, expert consensus has emerged regarding possible candidate disorders [Mataix-Cols, D., Petrusa, A., Leckman, J.F., 2007. Issues for DSM-V: How should obsessive-compulsive and related disorders should be classified. American Journal of Psychiatry, 164, 1313-1314]. Further, expert survey data suggest that obsessive-compulsive disorder is composed of overlapping subtypes. However, methodological approaches for testing whether candidate disorders properly belong in the spectrum have varied widely, and do not necessarily differentiate conditions from subtypes. We describe preliminary methodological and statistical recommendations for a systematic approach to determining what constitutes a subtype, how to determine inclusion in the spectrum, and means for ruling out candidate disorders. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

"Riches, NG",0,NO_TAXOMETRIC,Complex sentence profiles in children with Specific Language Impairment: Are they really atypical?,"Children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) have language difficulties of unknown origin. Syntactic profiles are atypical, with poor performance on non-canonical structures, e.g. object relatives, suggesting a localized deficit. However, existing analyses using ANOVAs are problematic because they do not systematically address unequal variance, or fully model random effects. Consequently, a Generalised Linear Model (GLM) was used to analyze data from a Sentence Repetition (SR) task involving relative clauses. seventeen children with SLI (mean age 6;7), twenty-one Language Matched (LM) children (mean age 4;8), and seventeen Age Matched (AM) children (mean age 6;5) repeated 100 canonical and non-canonical sentences. ANOVAs found a significant Group by Canonicity interaction for the SLI versus AM contrast only. However, the GLM found no significant interaction. Consequently, arguments for a localized deficit may depend on statistical methods which are prone to exaggerate profile differences. Nonetheless, a subgroup of SLI exhibited particularly severe structural language difficulties.",10.1017/S0305000915000847

"Klem, M; Hagtvet, B; Hulme, C; Gustafsson, JE",0,NO_TAXOMETRIC,Screening for Language Delay: Growth Trajectories of Language Ability in Low- and High-Performing Children,"Purpose: This study investigated the stability and growth of preschool language skills and explores latent class analysis as an approach for identifying children at risk of language impairment. Method: The authors present data from a large-scale 2-year longitudinal study, in which 600 children were assessed with a language-screening tool (LANGUAGE4) at age 4 years. A subsample (n = 206) was assessed on measures of sentence repetition, vocabulary, and grammatical knowledge at ages 4, 5, and 6 years. Results: A global latent language factor showed a high degree of longitudinal stability in children between the ages of 4 to 6 years. A low-performing group showing a language deficit compared to their age peers at age 4 was identified on the basis of the LANGUAGE4. The growth-rates during this 2-year time period were parallel for the low-performing and 3 higher performing groups of children. Conclusions: There is strong stability in children's language skills between the ages of 4 and 6 years. The results demonstrate that a simple language screening measure can successfully identify a low-performing group of children who show persistent language weaknesses between the ages of 4 and 6 years.",10.1044/2016_JSLHR-L-15-0289
"Castilla-Earls, A; Ronderos, J; Francis, DJ",0,POPULATION,Longitudinal Examination of Morphosyntactic Skills in Bilingual Children: Spanish and English Standardized Scores,"Purpose: This study aimed to examine changes in English and Spanish mor-phosyntactic standardized scores over time in bilingual children.Method: One hundred bilingual children participated in this longitudinal study. The average age of the children at the beginning of the study was 5;11 (years; months). A subset of the participants was identified as children with develop-mental language disorder (DLD, n = 43). Children completed behavioral testing in Spanish and English at three time points over a period of 2 years. Growth curve modeling was employed to analyze longitudinal data.Results: Distinct patterns of Spanish and English language growth were observed. While the average standard score in English increased, the average score in Spanish decreased over time for both groups. Children with DLD showed persistent language difficulties in both Spanish and English over time in comparison to their peers. Conclusions: The results of this study provide evidence of a shift in language pro-ficiency from Spanish to English for bilingual children with and without language disorders. This study also shows that bilingual children with DLD show a protracted but parallel growth in morphosyntactic skills in comparison to children without DLD.

"McGregor, KK; Goffman, L; Plante, E; Werfel, K",0,RECORD_TYPE,Developmental Language Disorder as a Multidimensional Neurodevelopmental Spectrum: Implications for Diagnosis,"Purpose: We aimed to create a comprehensive understanding of the dilemmas involved in the diagnosis of developmental language disorder (DLD) and to highlight the potential of a multidimensional spectral account of DLD for addressing these dilemmas. Method: We conducted an integrative literature review. Conclusions: Considerable gains in understanding the genetics and neurobiology of DLD provide new explanations for long-observed phenomena such as heterogeneity of presentation, phenotypic overlap with other neurodevelopmental conditions, and the challenges of diagnosis. Although categorical nosologies benefit diagnostic decision making, facilitate communication, and align well with bureaucratic systems, they offer overly simple ways of defining DLD. The presentation of DLD is broad rather than narrow, spectral rather than categorical, and dynamic rather than static; therefore, DLD is better described as a multidimensional spectral system than as a categorical entity. It is not practical or even advisable to abandon the traditional categorical framing of DLD at this point. However, maintaining awareness of the tension between the categorical framing and the spectral nature of DLD may improve diagnosis, prognosis, and alignment with the construct of neurodiversity.",10.1044/2025_JSLHR-25-00089

"Archibald, LMD; Griebeling, KH",0,NO_TAXOMETRIC,Rethinking the connection between working memory and language impairment,"Background: Working memory deficits have been found for children with specific language impairment (SLI) on tasks imposing increasing short-term memory load with or without additional, consistent (and simple) processing load.Aims: To examine the processing function of working memory in children with low language (LL) by employing tasks imposing increasing processing loads with constant storage demands individually adjusted based on each participant's short-term memory capacity.Methods & Procedures: School-age groups with LL (n = 17) and typical language with either average (n = 28) or above-average nonverbal intelligence (n = 15) completed complex working memory-span tasks varying processing load while keeping storage demands constant, varying storage demands while keeping processing load constant, simple storage-span tasks, and measures of language and nonverbal intelligence. Teachers completed questionnaires about cognition and learning.Outcomes & Results: Significantly lower scores were found for the LL than either matched group on storage-based tasks, but no group differences were found on the tasks varying processing load. Teachers' ratings of oral expression and mathematics abilities discriminated those who did or did not complete the most challenging cognitive tasks.Conclusions & Implications: The results implicate a deficit in the phonological storage but not in the central executive component of working memory for children with LL. Teacher ratings may reveal personality traits related to perseverance of effort in cognitive research.",10.1111/1460-6984.12202
"Lancaster, HS; Camarata, S",0,NO_TAXOMETRIC,Reconceptualizing developmental language disorder as a spectrum disorder: issues and evidence,"Background There is considerable variability in the presentation of developmental language disorder (DLD). Disagreement amongst professionals about how to characterize and interpret the variability complicates both the research on understanding the nature of DLD and the best clinical framework for diagnosing and treating children with DLD. We describe and statistically examine three primary possible models for characterizing the variability in presentation in DLD: predictable subtypes; individual differences; and continuum/spectrum. Aims To test these three models of DLD in a population-based sample using two distinct types of cluster analyses. Methods & Procedures This study included children with DLD (n = 505) from the US Epidemiological Study of Language Impairment database. All available language and cognitive measures were included. Two cluster methods were used: Ward's method and K-means. Optimal cluster sizes were selected using Bayesian information criteria (BIC). Bootstrapping and permutation methods were used to evaluate randomness of clustering. Outcomes & Results Both clustering analyses yielded more than 10 clusters, and the clusters did not have spatial distinction: many of these clusters were not clinically interpretable. However, tests of random clustering revealed that the cluster solutions obtained did not arise from random aggregation. Conclusions & Implications Non-random clustering coupled with a large number of non-interpretable subtypes provides empirical support for the continuum/spectrum and individual differences models. Although there was substantial support for the continuum/spectrum model and weaker support for the individual differences model, additional research testing these models should be completed. Based on these results, clinicians working with children with DLD should focus on creating treatment plans that address the severity of functioning rather than seeking to identify and treat distinct subtypes. Additional consideration should be given to reconceptualizing DLD as a spectrum condition.",10.1111/1460-6984.12433
"Leonard, LB",0,RECORD_TYPE,Specific Language Impairment Across Languages,"Children with specific language impairment (SLI) have a significant and longstanding deficit in spoken language ability that adversely affects their social and academic well-being. Studies of children with SLI in a wide variety of languages reveal diverse symptoms, most of which seem to reflect weaknesses in grammatical computation and phonological short-term memory. The symptoms of the disorder are sensitive to the type of language being acquired, with extraordinary weaknesses seen in those areas of language that are relatively challenging for younger typically developing children. Although these children's deficits warrant clinical and educational attention, their weaknesses might reflect the extreme end of a language aptitude continuum rather than a distinct, separable condition.",10.1111/cdep.12053

Method: A systematic search was carried out in Psycinfo and CINHAL databases. Only five studies met selection criteria. Results: Three main findings were identified: (1) there is a scarcity of empirical research regarding attachment concepts among adults with ID, related to a lack of established measures among this population; (2) there is some evidence that insecure attachment among adults with ID is associated with adverse early life experiences and current mental health difficulties; and (3) there is conflicting evidence that attachment behaviours may present as challenging to supporters.

"Newbury, DF; Monaco, AP; Paracchini, S",0,RECORD_TYPE,Reading and Language Disorders: The Importance of Both Quantity and Quality,"Reading and language disorders are common childhood conditions that often co-occur with each other and with other neurodevelopmental impairments. There is strong evidence that disorders, such as dyslexia and Specific Language Impairment (SLI), have a genetic basis, but we expect the contributing genetic factors to be complex in nature. To date, only a few genes have been implicated in these traits. Their functional characterization has provided novel insight into the biology of neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the lack of biological markers and clear diagnostic criteria have prevented the collection of the large sample sizes required for well-powered genome-wide screens. One of the main challenges of the field will be to combine careful clinical assessment with high throughput genetic technologies within multidisciplinary collaborations.",10.3390/genes5020285
